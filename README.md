## BIOSKETCH

I am a Principal Scientist, based in Brisbane, Australia. My specialization includes ecosystem modeling, remote sensing, spatial analysis, life cycle assessment, big data, and machine learning for agricultural systems. I was a Fulbright Scholar and a U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University, a leading institution in the U.S. for soil carbon and sustainability research. I served as one of the main developers of the DayCent ecosystem model at Colorado State University (CSU). Throughout my career, I have developed multiple decision-support applications using process-based ecosystem models. These include Comet Farm (used by the USDA), Soil Metrics (used by Indigo Ag), Ag-EcoSOpt (used by Shell Oil Company), and DayCent-AU and SOCRATES soil carbon models (currently under development at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT)). I also possess exemplary leadership experience, having led integrated environmental assessment projects at the Shell Technology Centre in Houston (USA), CSU, and QUT. Additionally, I have contributed to the development of the Australian Carbon Credit Methodology Determination 2021, the official Australian soil carbon credit calculators, and the grazingDNDC model at Regrow.
