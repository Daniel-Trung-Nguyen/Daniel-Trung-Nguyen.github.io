## BIOSKETCH

I am a Principal Scientist, based in Brisbane, Australia. My specialization includes ecosystem modeling, remote sensing, spatial analysis, life cycle assessment, big data, and machine learning for agricultural systems. I was a Fulbright Scholar and a U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University, a leading institution in the U.S. for soil carbon and sustainability research. I served as one of the main developers of the DayCent ecosystem model at Colorado State University (CSU). Throughout my career, I have developed multiple decision-support applications using process-based ecosystem models. These include Comet Farm (USDA), Soil Metrics (Indigo Ag), Ag-EcoSOpt (Shell Oil Company), DayCent-AU soil carbon model (Queensland University of Technology QUT), ForeSiteTM (Ukko Ag), and the California Resiliency Index (CaRI) at California State University (CHICO). I also possess exemplary leadership experience, having led integrated environmental assessment projects at the Shell Technology Centre in Houston (USA), CSU, QUT, and CHICO. Additionally, I have contributed to the development of the Australian Carbon Credit Methodology Determination 2021, the official Australian soil carbon credit calculators, and the development of the grazingDNDC model at Regrow.
