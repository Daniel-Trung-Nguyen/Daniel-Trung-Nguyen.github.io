### 11. Additional Model Development
11.1. Assess the need for additional model development to support specific project requirements. The model may not perform optimally for specific crops or practices that necessitate more extensive model development to support their functionality.

## B. Proposed Collaboration and Service Tiers

| Tier | My Role | Time Allocation | What Does This Mean to you? | What Does It Mean to the Project Progression? |
|------|---------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1 | Support / Consulting | 5 - 10 hours | - I will support the team with setting directions and completing well-defined tasks and subtasks within the time budget. Requirements from you: - an experienced project manager to arrange and delegate tasks, evaluate performance and progress. - supporting staff such as senior/junior modelers (1-2) | Slower (depending on the learning curve and management efficiency) |
| Tier 2 | Co-pilot | 10 - 15 hours | - Tier 1 + I can help manage part of the project and pilot certain components as time allowed. Requirements from you: - a junior project manager - supporting staff (1) | Fast |
| Tier 3 | Pilot | 15 - 20 hours | - I will manage the project and delegate tasks. - I will oversee the modeling activities - I will complete required tasks and subtasks within the time budget. Requirements from you: - supporting staff (1) | Fastest (I would expect this to cut the time by half) |
